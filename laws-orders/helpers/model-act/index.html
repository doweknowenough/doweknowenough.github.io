		<h2>Issues</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Button with every amending act for choosing to implement amendments upto that act. Use javascript function of getdocumentbyId and changing innerHTML
			</li>
			<li>
				How to add such list indices- 7A?
			</li>
			<li>
				Customised Printing command. It should remove all hyperlinks, all ****, all Omitted etc from the main content
			</li>
			<li>
				Reducing margin between paragraph and list. Could use < br > tag or adjust that specific p-li combo via css
			</li>
			<li>
				Rethinking omission function. We need to change visibility only, right? Code can remain there.
			</li>

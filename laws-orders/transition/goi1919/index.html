			The Government of India Act 1919
			AN ACT TO MAKE FURTHER PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.
			PREAMBLE
			WHEREAS it is tho declared policy of Parliament to provide for the increasing association of Indians in every branch of Indian
			administration, and for the gradual development of self-governing
			institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible
			government in British India as an integral part of tho Empire ;
			And whereas progress in giving effect to this policy can only
			be achieved by successive stages, and it is expedient that substan- tial stops in this direction should now bo taken ;
			And whereas the time and manner of each advance can be
			determined only by Parliament, upon whom responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples :
			And whereas the action of Parliament in such matters must be guided by the co-operation received from those on whom new opportunities of service will be conferred, and by the extent to
			which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of
			responsibility :
			And whereas concurrently with the gradual development of
			self-governing institutions in the Provinces of India it is expedient to give to those Provinces in provincial matters tho largest measure of independence of tho Government of India which is compatible with tho duo discharge by the latter of its own responsibilities :
			Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and
			Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :

			The following is the full text of the report :
			Chapter I. Preliminary.
			As a preliminary to const i rational reforms, tho authors of the
			Montagu-Chelmsford Report urged the importance of a complete
			between the finances of tho Central Government in India and those of the various Provincial governments. To this end they outlined the scheme described in Chapter virr of their report. It abrogates the present system by which certain of the main heads of revenue and expenditure are divided between the central and the provincial exchequers ; some of these it hands over wholly to tho Central Government, others wholly to the provinces. Inasmuch, however, as by this rearrangement the Government of India will lose heavily the scheme proposes to compensate them, to such extent as may be necessary, to prevent a deficit in their own 1>udget, by contributions from the
			contributions is taken in section 1 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1919.
			2. In assessing this levy tho authors of the report met with a serious obstacle in the disparity which already exists between local Governments in the pitch of theii revenues and the scale of their
			expenditure, a disparity deep rooted in the economic position of tho different provinces, their revenue history and the tale of their oft-
			revised financial arrangements with the Central Government. For this inequality of burdens the authors of the report found no remedy in the several alternative methods of fixing the provincial contribu- tions which they examined. Their ultimate choice fell upon an assessment in the ratio of the gross surplus which they estimated that each province would enjoy under the new allocation of resources. In recognition of the admitted fact that this method would largely affirm existing inequalities, they advised that the whole question should be re-investigated by the statutory commission after ten years7 working.
			3. The Government of India, in expressing their views on tho scheme, pressed for an earlier treatment of the matter vide para- graph 61 of their despatch of the 5th Marth 1919. They described

			the feeling which had been aroused against the prima facie injustice of the exemplar figures given in the report. They urged that any
			such settlement should be recognised as temporary and provisional, and that steps be taken as soon as possible to fix a standard and
			equitable scale of contributions towards which the
			will be required to work by stages, as a condition of the new arrange- ments/' They proposed the appointment of a Committee on Finan-
			cial Eolations to advise on the subject. This recommendation was accepted and endorsed by the Joint Select Committee of Parliament which sat on the Eeform Bill. We were accordingly appointed by the Secretary of State, arid given the following terms of reference :
			To advise on
			(a) the contributions to be paid by the various provinces to the Central Government for the financial year 1921-22 ;
			equitable distribution until there
			ceases to be an all India deficit ;
			V) the future financing of the provincial loan accounts and ;
			(d) whether the Government of Bombay should retain any share of the revenue derived from income-tax.

			tively ; and we are indebted to the two Chief Commissioners for meeting us in this request at some inconvenience to themselves. Our
			procedure was to discuss the subjects of our inquiry in each province with the Member of the Executive Council who holds the financial
			portfolio, or, in provinces where there is no Council, with the Secre- tary in charge of the Financial Department, and with such other
			officials as those gentlemen introduced. Sir Nicholas
			the Chief Commissioner of Assam, presented the case of his province in person. After taking the official evidence we.met these members of the Finance Committee of the

			5. In order to effect the desired separation of central from
			provincial finance, the Montagu-Chelmsford Report (paragraph 203) proposes that the central exchequer should receive the whole of the
			Income-tax and the revenue from General Stamps-; and that the provinces should retain the entire receipts from Land Revenue, Irrigation, Excise and Judicial Stamps, while they should be wholly
			responsible for the corresponding charges and for all expenditure in connection with famine. We read the Joint Select Committee of
			Parliament as approving this redistribution, and wo considered that it would be outside our duty to advise any alteration of the scheme in the respect unless wo found the strongest reason for a change. The argument addressed to us on this branch of the subject have related mainly to Income-tax and General Stamps. Certain local Governments have remonstrated against losing a share in those two heads, and the plea for making the whole or at least one half,
			of the income tax receipts a provincial asset was pressed with special earnestness in Bombay, Under our instructions wo have to report
			on the point for that presidency, but we have found it difficult
			to treat the issue as applicable to one province only. The grounds of the Bombay claim are common to all provinces, and more especially to those in which large commercial and Industrial activities
			are centred.
			6. The basic objection to the transfer of Income tax is that the provinces will thus be deprived of any share in a head of revenue which has recently shown a remarkable capacity for expansion, while they are left to finance their rapidly growing administrative needs with heads of revenue in which the increase is slow or problematical. How far the remarkable growth of the income-tax receipts in late years has been stimulated by war conditions, wo have not attempted to estimate ; but we are assured that large improve- ments are being made in the assessment staff and -in their methods, and that a rapid and continuous growth in the return may be counted upon. Several Local Governments urge that the yield from income-tax is the only direct contribution to their public revenue which is made by the industrial wealth of their province, and Governmentsi which administer great mercantile and manu- facturing centres like Calcutta and Bombay, claim special consider-
			ation for the heavy expenditure in which those centres involve them, To these arguments the Bombay Government added their apprehension that a time may come when a local Government may not be anxious to direct, or its officers zealous to enforce, the
			collection of a tax which bring no grist to the provincial mill, This

			 52 HEPOUT OF THE
			last contention was put forcibly ; but we presume that the Govern- ment of India will not be powerless to require the fulfilment by a provincial Government of its obligations under the new constitution, and that public service will not be revised in carrying out public duties with which they can be charged by law.
			Wedoubt if it will be
			Local Governments from some form of direct taxation upon the industrial and commercial earnings of their people; and wo
			recognise the natural anxiety of-provinces to retain a share in a rapidly improving head of revenue.But, so far as the income-tax is concerned, we see no reasons to vary the scheme of the .Report. Wo accept as valid the arguments given by its authors (paragraph 203) ; indeed, the second of these arguments seems to us capable of further extension in the case of public companies with share-holders scattered over India and elsewhere. We advise, therefore, that the whole of the income-tax proceeds be credited to the Central Government. Their needs in the near future are likely to be quite
			as great and to develop quite as rapidly, as those of the provinces ; while wo do riot apprehend that the richer provinces, v such as Bombay, will be seriously handicapped in the administration of their own finances. We append, and shall allude to them hereafter, some figures which indicate that several of the provinces, and Bombay in particular, may look for reasonable elasticity in their revenues apart from th* income-tax an elasticity which will in most cases be encouraged by judicious capital outlay.

			not the implied promise, of the report. No remedy suggests itself except some extension of the schedule of provincial heads ; doles and temporary assistance would be inconsistent with the whole policy. In this view, and also because it will greatly facilitate our initial distribution of the central deficit, we advise that General
			Stamps be made a provincial head throughout. The arguments in the report for crediting it to the Central Government have not the
			same force as in the case of income-tax. Wo are not disposed to see
			grave disadvantage in different rates of stamp duty in different provinces, at least on some of the transactions for which duty has
			to be paid ; and any uniformity which may bo decided to be
			essential can always be secured by central legislation. Moreover,
			The case of General Stamps is somewhat different. We
			<s.
			have approached it, in the first instance, from the point of view of the poorer Provinces. Some of these, it seems clear, would start with little or no surplus revenue, under the allocation of resources proposed in the report ; and this would be both a misfortune in itself and at variance with what we believe to be iho intention, if
			in this part of the arrangements, there is still the
			divided head, for General arid Judicial Stamps are controlled by the same agency, and there is a good deal of miscellaneous work and outlay .common Nto both. To make the whole of the Stamp revenue
			provincial would secure a genuine arid complete separation of resources ; and we trust that the reasons for this course will outweigh
			the only consideration on the other side, to wit, the extent to which the deficit in the all India budget will thereby be increased.
			(J. That, deficit- we accept, subject to certain arithmetical adjustments described below, as amounting in the year 1921.122 to 10 crores, composed of the G orores previously estimated by the Govern- ment of India plus 4 crores for the loss of General Stamps which we propose. We have carefully examined the basis of this calcula- tion. Clearly, we have no authority to criticise 'the military and financial policy on which it so largely rests : and we have restricted ourselves to a scrutiny of the budget arrangements of the Govern ment of India, past and present, and of the normal growth of their revenue and expenditure. Factors of great uncertainty, the needs of India's defence, her tariff policy and the future of
			exchange among others, complicate the estimate, but we are satisfied that the Government of India have made reasonable
			allowance for those considerations in their forecast of the immediate financial future. On our tour in the provinces, it has been pressed upon us that the Government of India ought to meet their own
			deficit by special taxation, and a high protective
			taint of a
			tariff has

			 54 IMPORT OF Tttti
			frequently been mentioned to us as an easy solution of the problem.
			On this latter question we naturally express no opinion :
			cannot see that the Government of India would have
			but we
			any justi-
			fication in imposing special taxation to make good their initial
			shortage of revenue, at a time when the shortage in question will
			be more than counterbalanced by the additional resources enjoyed by local Government. As we have said, therefore, we accept the estimate of the normal deficit for the first year of the new constitution. We cannot conceal from ourselves the
			disadvantages in ordinary circumstances of a system of provincial contributions
			and we anticipate that the Government of India will direct its financial policy towards reducing those contributions with responsible rapidity, and their ultimate cessation. We recognise that it would be imprudent on the part of the Central Government to give any guarantee of the precise pace of reduction ; but we think that a formal enunciation of the general policy would go some way to allay apprehensions which have been expressed to us. Such a
			would clearly be subject to the important reservation mentioned in the report, by which the Central Government* must
			remainempoweredtolevyspecial contributions,bywayoftemporary loan or otherwise, from the provinces in the event of any crisis of
			first importance.
			10. In arriving at the figure which has actually to be distri-
			buted over the Provinces we have had to make certain adjustments. One of these is special and local, and we may dispose of it at once on the clear understanding that our treatment of the matter is entirely subject to the approval of the Government of India. It relates to the incidence of the cost of the military police force in Burma. The Government of the province, we understand, is discus- sing the point with the Government of India ; and their view, as
			policy
			to us, is that 68 percent of the expenditure on the force is incurred for further defence and ought to be deficit to the central
			expressed
			The figures originally before us had suggested a division Of the cost of the force equally between the Government of India and Burma, but the Local Government now presses for more
			generous treatment and estimates that the share of the outlay on the
			military police which is equitably chargeable to the province is only 1742 lakhs ngainst the 31-58 lakhs whidi had been taken in an earlier
			calculation. Subject to the assent of the Government of India, we

			this view ; and we are reducing the
			expenditure accordingly, and making an equivalent addi- tion to the charges, and thus to the deficit, of the Central Govern-
			ment. The main adjustments that have been suggested however, ara concerned with the payment of pensions, At present the Central
			have provisionally accepted

			Government is debited with all civil pensions drawn outside India
			whether the pensioner has served in a province or in an imperial
			department, and no debit is raised against the provinces concerned.
			On the other hand, pensioners whose service has been under the
			Central Government are paid by the province in which they reside,
			which received nothing in recoupment. It has been suggested that
			pensions paid outside India ought to be debited to the provinces
			when they are paid to provincial servants arid simultaneously that
			the Government of India should relieve the provinces by paying their
			own pensioners. So 'far as the future is concerned, the propriety of
			this change is beyond question. Doubts, however, occured to us
			regarding existing payments. Exchange complications and difficul- ties of exact allocation interfere with precision ; while other and
			more general considerations point on the whole to the advisability of retaining on the books of the Central and Provincial Governments respectively the pensions for which they are at present responsible.
			We advise, therefore, that the readjustments of debits should take place only for pensions sanctioned on or after the 1st April 1921, and thn-t pensions drawn before that date should be allowed to workthemselvesoffonthepresentfooting; thisarrangementbeing
			definitely
			made a feature in the financial settlement. We may note
			incidentally with reference to a point raised by the Panjab, that
			provinces have no claim on any annuity fund in respect of those
			members of the Indian Civil Service from whose pay a 4 per cent- deduction has until recently heen made under the general rules in the Civil Service Regulations. There is in fact no annuity fund in such cases, and the deduction has simply lapsed to provincial revenues. The result of our recommendations in this matter is that it does not necessitate any immediate change in the all- India deficit ; the net growth of their pension liabilities in future is a relatively small matter for which the provinces may be left to make provision with- out special assistance. The last adjustment to be made is on account of leave allowances drawn outside India. Three are paid at present in the same way as pensions drawn outside India, in future they ought certainly to be debited to the provinces concerned, The normal liability on this account can approximately be calculated and the Secretary of State has given us a figure of 311,000 for the nine provinces affected
			by our enquiry. We have converted this at two shillings
			rupee, distributed the liability among the provinces and subtracted 31*10 lakhs from the Imperial charges and deficit. The latter
			thus works out to 10 crores plus 14*16 lakhs for the Burma

			REPORT OF THE

			The Initial Contributions.
			We can now proceed to fix the ratio in which each of the nine provinces should contribute to this figure of 983 lakhs in the year 1921-22. It will clear the ground to state at the outset a
			limiting consideration by which we have felt ourselves bound. This is an obligation to leave each province with a reasonable
			Working surplus a surplus which we should prefer to calculate so far as possible, with some relation to the general financial position
			of the province and the more imminent claims upon its resources.
			From the preliminary enquiry conducted at Simla in October last, it
			'is apparent that in certain provinces no surplus at all and in others
			no adequate surplus, would have been possible without provinciali- sation of the revenue from General stamps and our task would thus in our judgement have been futile. Looked at somewhat differently, the limit we have imposed on ourselves is that i
			case may a contribution be such as would force the province to embark on new taxation atl hoc, which to our minds would be an unthinkable sequel to a purely administrative rearrargement of abundant general resources. This limit, however, obvious as it is, makes it inevitable that the initial contributions should be in some
			measure arbitrary, dictated by the existing financial position of each
			province and not by any equitable standard such as its capacity to pay. Whatever standard ratio of contributions we might advise,
			and a subsequent chapter will narrate our proposal in that direction, it would have, were it to bo applied immediately, the effect of starting some provinces on their new career with deficit, and we
			have thus to accept some measure of transition.
			12. We have now to explain our reasons for suggesting a departure from the basis of initial contribution proposed in the Mont;gue-Chelmsford report. Wo are aware that that basis was not lightly adopted, and only after consideration of various alternative
			basis, population, provincial, revenue or expenditure, arid the like which for one reason or another were thought inapplicable to existing conditions. The basris of realised surplus was finally accept- ed partly because of the difficulty of finding a ^referable alternative, partly because at all events it did not add to, though it continued, existingdisparitiesofcontribution Thatithasbeenfreelycriticised in evidence before us as unequitable is certainly not fatal to it, for indeed every initial basis that can be suggested is open to some such sriticism, but examination has revealed some objections to it which
			weigh with us.
			13. Obviously if any inequalities of contribution exist, the basis chosen tends to stereotype them while by disclosing them it

			renders them more difficult to justify ; for each province is now able to see more clearly than under the former system its relative contribution to the purse of the Government of India. While actual
			deficits appear, as has been said, in some provinces, others complain that their apparent surplus, if rightly understood, makes a real deficit. The prospect of arriving at any accepted figures as a basis appears remote. While the figures of the Simla Conference as to ( normal provincial revenue are accepted with minor modifications of detail, the estimates.of normal expenditure in each province are strongly contested. How much of the expenditure held over during the war, arc clearly imminent if not already sanctioned and ought to bo included in tho calculation of normal expenditure ?
			immediate future and expenditure foreseen as a future commitment1 Ought a province to be penalised by an increase of its contribution for strict adhesion to economy during tho war while another province, which had increased its expenditure more freely is rewarded by a reduced contribution'? Is adequate allowance made
			for tho special conditions of a largely undeveloped province like Burma, or lor the circumstances of a recently established province like Behar and Orissa which claims that it has never received from its start resources adequate to its needs 1 No satisfactory results seemed likely to bo reached by our attempting to act as a court of appeal in contentions of this kind. Moreover the artificial and temporary nature of the basis cannot be overlooked. It is too much determined by mere accidents of budgetting in spite of attempts to
			char away abnormalities of expenditure. But even if a normal surplus can be agreed at tho moment, it tends to be obscured or to
			disappcai in tho budgets of succeeding years. How could a contribu-
			tion be levied in later years on the basis of a so-called normal surplus
			which did doubtless once exist and might be said to bo implied in
			the economic life of the province, but which in fact had disappeared
			to be replaced by a totally different surplus or perhaps by a deficit? Tho best argument for tho basis of realised surplus was that, when
			originally recommended, it did recognise existing facts, that it appeared to leave all the provinces collectively with improved finances and each individual province with a surplus, and that it
			proceeded upon tho principle of creating the minimum of financial disturbance in introducing the Keforms scheme.
			14* But these advantages cari be secured by another solution, which after careful consideration we think is less open to question. It must be noted that even if the original classification of sources of
			revenue in the Monfcagu-Chelmsford report is strictly adhered to, each one of the provinces gains something in revenue, while some

			gain very substantially in consequence of the introduction of the Reform scheme. If our recommendation as to General Stamps is
			accepted, the net increase in the total income of all the pro\inces taken together works out at 1850 lakhs. These additional resources represent uhat the central Government loses and the provinces gain under the redistribution. Some parts of them the former may reasonably retain and latter forego, so long as contributions to the central Government remain necessary. Even those provinces which were found at the Simla Conference to be in deficit secured some improvement in their revenues under the original classification, an improvement which will of course be increased by tho addition of General Stamps. It has been urged upon us that this increased spending power will in fact be swallowed up
			by the higher cost of administration, 'by improvement of old services, or by inauguration of new. At this stage, however, we are considering merely the revenue side of the account. These future liabilities would have had to be faced by each province, if no "Reforms Scheme had come. Each province is the better able tp face them by reason of the additional resources it has secured. There is the advantage that the figures of normal revenue laid down at the Simla Conference, have been submitted to Local Governments, and
			with minor amendments, which we have been able to accept, arc
			agreed as arithmetically correct, We propose, subject to the limiting consideration referred to in paragragh II, to assess the initial contribution on this increase of spending power in the
			provinces. The proposal has the merit of proceeding on the lines of
			minimum disturbance of the Financial position in each province. It
			will enable us to comply with the requirements of Iravihg each
			province with a surplus, and of inaugurating the new Councils without the necessity of resort to fresh taxation.
			15. It is of importance to realise the nature of this transaction
			In the first place it implies no judgment on the merits of previous financial settlements with any province. Tho increase in revenues
			comes to the provinces as a windfall, or as :i bye-product of a constitutional change. It is not due as financial settlements have been in the past to consideration of the financial needs of individual provinces. It cannot properly be quoted as an admission of financial inequalities or as an act of tardy justice to the provinces that gain by it. Clearly it has come from political and not primarily from financial motives. It originates in the desire to secure a greater measure of devolution in the provinces, and in the endeavour to draw for this purpose a defensible line of financial partition between local Governments and the Government of India. While we consider that a windfall of this nature affords a suitable basis for

			 FINANCIAL 11ELATIONX COMMITTEE 50
			initial contributions by the provinces it is not surprising to find that its application requires some modifications in view of individual circumstances.
			Secondly, on this basis the system of contribution appears in a less invidious light. The Central Government in the course of a political reconstruction gives to each of the local Govern- ments some, and to some local Governments a very considerable, increase of spending power. Finding itself in a deficit as the result of this re-construction, it withholds from each province a certain proportion of the increased resources which it is intended that the' province should eventually obtain. The
			Central Government does not come in as raiding the hard-won surplus of a province, nor ought the Central Government to
			be represented, if our proposal be accepted, as the pensioner of tho provinces. It can hardly be contended that a province, which has at all events decidedly improved its finances as a result of tho change, has valid ground of complaint, if it does not obtain immediately the full increment which it may subsequently realise. In the cases of the provinces that gain most, it would hardly bo
			possible for any such province to spend in the first year the whole of its suddenly increased resources ; and if it wore possible, it would be financially undesirable. We think therefore that this basis
			affords less scope for controversy arid may be accepted as both more logical and more equitable than the Montagu-Chelmsford Report.
			16. A detailed calculation (of which copies are being handed to the Government of India) has accordingly been made to ascertain the net additional revenues with which each province will bo endowed by the new allocation of resources. Starting on the assumption
			that our proposal about General Stamps will be adopted, we have worked on the figures of moral income which were accepted at the Simla Conference and on figures similarly accepted when we camo to tabulate tho expenditure which will be transferred to and from provinces. Wo took tho calculations with us on tour, discussed them with the officials of each province, and made several correction at their instance. The figures of increased spending power on which we ultimately acted may be regarded as agreed figures. Certain provinces urged that they are unduly favourable to our argument, as the great rise this year in the income-tax receipts means a correspondingly greater loss to local Governments when they cease to enjoy a share of those receipts. Provision however clearly demands that all our standard should be based on figures for the same years ; and there would be advantage in elaborating a series of normal statistics different from those which
			specifically prepared

			 66 ItEl'OliT OP THE
			to assist us in our enquiry. We were also pressed to make allow- ances for schemes of future expenditure to which special importance was attached ; but to this we have been unable to accede as it is not our task to make budget fore-cast.
			17. Having arrived in the manner indicated at the extra spending power which will accrue to each province, we first consider- ed the possibility of secitring the All-India deficit by an even rate
			on all the provincial figures. So far-reaching, however, is the disparity in the financial strength of the provinces that even this
			would in some cases have caused hardship. The extreme case would bo that of a province which has been depending largely on doles from the central exchequer ; and difficulty arises wherever the provincial revenues arc so pinched that the new resources have had to be seriously discounted to provide for the normal expenditure. \Ve have therefore had to consider each province on its merits, relying both on the abundant statistical information which was placed at our disposal and on the insight which we gained into the general situation by our local consultations with the best expert opinion. Our recommendations may be conveniently set out in the following statement, which
			explains itself when read with the succeeding paragraphs : [IN LAKHS]

			IS. The provinces which caused us most anxiety were Burma and Orissa. In the former the coming improvement in its revenues hag been largely discounted by the heavy commitments necessary to

			 FINANCIAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE 61
			give Burma Ilie responsible administrative conveniences which it
			now lacks. The province, as wo have satisfied ourselves, is far bshiii'l Ludii propar in whit its Government does for the people. Profits flowing from the rioa control scheme, and a wise outlay of
			borrowed capital, should enable rapid progress now to be made but
			the heavy recurring expenditure which development entails will bo more imminent than the new income which it will yield. We aro
			convinced that a very substantial share of the surplus revenues of this province should be left free, and our calculations have led us to fix on them only about six and half per cent of the total deficit ; this happens, as will be seen below, to equal what we determine as the standard ratio of contribution. In Behar and Orissa the local Government is quite the poorest in India and every special skill will be required in developing its resources. Heavy initial expendi-
			ture lies in front of what is still a new province and here is a wholly abnormal want of elasticity about its revenues. We cannot advise that any share of the deficit should be taken from Bihar and Orissa in 1921-22 and wo expect that the province will bo sufficiently burdened by having to work up to its standard ratio of contribution in the same poriod as the rest of India.
			19. Th<3 two provinces which come next in difficulty are the Central Provinces and Assam. They have a small margin at tho best of times, and their need for development is groat. The former has a moro rapidly expanding revenue than tho latter, but on tho other hand, its finances are moro liable to disturbance by famine. On the wholo we do not fool that it would be just to ask more than roughly 40 per cent of their windfall in both cases, and we have
			based our recommendations accordingly.
			20. The special treatment of these four provinces loft us with
			882 lakhs to allocate among their five richer neighbours ; and this sum would bo secured by a fiat rate of about 60 per cent on their new revenues. After the most careful scrutiny of their various peculiarilies we sco no marker! necessity for differential treatment inters-). In Mi'lr.n and tin (Juit3'l Provinces tho windfall is so vast that it could not bo employed profitably for several years. On the other hand, their revenues do not promise any remarkable elasticity, economy has boon strictly practised, and considerable arrears of administrative progress are now duo. In the Panjab also the windfall is large and balances are full while here tho reve- nues move upwards with marked ease. The position is less simple for diverse reasons in Bombay and Bengal. Tho former has attained a scale of expenditure far above the Indian average and the pace of
			expansion of its revenues is distinctly higher than in any other province, We believe that it could without inconvenience forego

			 G2 UEPOUT OF THE
			the greater part of its new resources at the outset, and help the less fortunate provinces from its own abundant balance. But we hesitate to differentiate it prejudicially from the other richer provinces. Bengal on the other hand has a low scale of expendi- ture and an inelastic revenue: and it will receive only a very moderate start in its new financial career. But its size, intrinsic wealth and general economic possibilities prevented us from treating it more favourably than the other provinces in this category.
			21. On a general view of the table the heavy contributions of Madras, the United Provinces and the Punjab doubtless call for comment. Between them these three provinces have to bear 35*5 24-5 and 8 per cent respectively, of the total initial contribution making 78 per cent of the whole. Conversely, the light assessments
			of Bengal and Bombay contributing 6-5 and 5-5 per cent respecti- vely of the levy will be noticed. But the character of the transaction as described above must be borne in mind. If the contribution represented some new and additional burden extracted from the
			wealths of the provinces, objection might fairly be taken. But it really amounts to the requirement that Madras is called upon to content itself in the initial year with an improvement in its fevenue of 228 lakhs instead of a possible maximum of 576; United Provinces with an improvement of 157 lakhs instead of a possible 397 and the Punjab with an improvement of 111 lakhs instead of a possible
			289. The weight of the contribution by the Provinces is the best index to the amount of their gains, both immediate, and, as will be
			under the new financial scheme. Just because immediately they are substantial gainers, they can best afford to postpone the full enjoyment of their ultimate advantages.
			22. If on the other hand it is urged that some provinces,
			Bengal and Bombay for instance, escape too lightly under this assess- ment, the answer is two-fold. In the first place they are light gainers
			in the new distribution of revenues, Bengal having a gross gain of 104 lakhs and Bombay of 93. Secondly, we have not overlooked
			tho claim of certain provinces to exemption from the levy iu virt\M* of their indirect contributions through customs and income-tax*'to the Government of India. While this claim is often over-stated
			and exaggerated, we recognised that provinces with commercial capitals such as Calcutta and Bombay make larger contributions
			through these channels than purely agricultural provinces; and it will be noticed that those provinces where payment to the Govern-
			ment of India through customs and income-tax is presumably highest make a light contribution to the provincial levy.

			 FINANCIAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE 63 ChapterIV. TheStandardContributions.
			23. Our recommendation as to the ratio on which the Provinces can properly be called upon to contribute the deficit of the Govern- ment of India in the first year of contribution (paragraph 17 above) is based, as already stated, upon consideration of their present financial positions and of the immediate improvement which will be effected therein by the redistribution of revenues under the Reforms Scheme. This ratio is not intended in any manner to represent the ideal scale on which the Provinces should in equity bo called upon
			to contribute, nor is it possible that ifc should do so. In making our recommendation as to the initial contributions wo have had to consider established programmes of taxation and expenditure, and legislative and administrative expectations and habits, that cannot without serious mischief ba. suddenly adjusted to a no\\ and more equitable ratio of contribution widely different (as an equitable ratio must admittedly be) from that of the past. It is accordingly inevitable, if such mischief is to be avoided, that the ratio for initial contributions should bear little relation to that which would bo ideally equitable. But an initial ratio of this nature can only bo defended as a measure of transition. It is necessary, but it is
			necessary only in order to pive time to the Provinces to adjust tl eir
			1 Budgets to a new stats of affairs
			no scheme of contribution can be satisfactory that does not provide for a -more equitable distribution of the burden of the deficit within a reasonable time.
			24. The ideal basis for such an equitable distribution can bo stated with some certainty. To do equity between the Provinces it is necessary that the total contribution of each to tho purse of the Government of India should be proportionate to its capacity to contribute. Unfortunately the application of this principle in
			practice presents many
			difficulties.
			;
			and we are clearly of opinion that
			25. The total contribution of a Province to the purso of tho Government of India will consist in future of its direct contribution towards the deficit, together with its indirect contribution (as at present) through the channels of customs, income-tax, duties on salt, etc. A valuation of the amount of this indirect contribution involves an exact arithmetical calculation of the proportion of the total sum collected under each of those heads of revenue which is properly attributable to each Province. For such a calculation the statistical information available as to the distribution of the revenue
			between the Provinces is not adequate. Under the head of customs the locality in which dutiable articles are consumed cannot be traced with sufficient accuracy j under that of income-tax, questions of

			 64 HEPORT OF THti
			the utmost complexity arise as to the true local source of the income assessed questions which the information in the hands of th9 assessing officers does not enable them to answer. We have never- theless carried our investigation into this matter as far as available information permits, and by moans of an examination of the statistics concerning the distribution of articles which have paid customs duty,
			and of those concerning the place of collection of income-tax, together with a review of the more general circumstances of the economic life of the Provinces we have found it possible to arrive at an estimate of the weight which should be given in fixing the basis for equitable contributions by the Provinces, to their indirect
			contributions.
			26. Turning to the other circumstance which must be
			considered in fixing the ideal basis for an equitable distribution
			the capacities of the Provinces to contribute wo find practical
			difficulties no less great than in the exact arithmetical calculation
			of the quantities involved. The capacity of a province to contribute
			is its taxable capacity, which is the sum of the incomes of iU tax-
			payers, or tho average income of its tax-payers multiplied by their number. Inthisconnectionalsothestatistical informationavailable
			does not permit of any direct valuation. Enquiries of much
			interest have been made at various times with a \ie\v to calculating
			the wealth of the respective Provinces or the average income ofv
			their respective inhabitants, and the results provided much useful
			information ; but in the absence of any general assessment of
			incomes, and of any census of production, they cannot be considered
			reliable as a direct estimate of the quantities concerned. In
			tho absence of any such direct estimate, various circumstances
			have been suggested to us as capable of serving, taken separately or together, as an indirect measure of the relathe taxable capacities
			of tho Provinces. Amongst these may be mentioned gross population, urban arid rural, or industrial and agricultural population ; cultivated
			ares ; provincial revenue, or provincial expenditure ; amount of income-tax collected ; and, moro indirect, amount of salt or of foreign textile goods consumed in each Province. As measures of all these are open to obvious criticisms, both on theoretical and on practical grounds. We are of opinion, however, that some of them are not without their value as a substitute for the direct information which is not available and they have indeed assisted us in coming to a general conclusion as to the relative taxable
			capacities of the provinces. But we are also of opinion that none of them is capable of serving, either alone or in conjunction with others, as an accurate or even an approximate arithmetical measure
			of those capacities,

			64(a) 27. For the reasons given, we believe it to be useless to attempt to state a formula, to servo as a basis for ;i standard ratio of contribu- tions, capable of automatic application from year to year by reference to ascertained statistics. Although the formula could be stated, the statistics which would be needed for its application are not available. But we are able, after surveying such figures as are available and after close enquiry into the circumstances of each province, to recommend a fixed ratio of contributions which in our opinion represents a standard and equitable distribution of the burden of any deficit. In arriving at this, ratio we have taken into consideration the indirect contributions of the provinces to the purse of the Govern- ment of India, and in particular the incidence of customs duties and of income-tax. We have enquired into the relative taxable capaci- ties of the provinces, in the light of their agricultural and industrial wealth and of all other relevant incidents of their economic positions including particularly their liability to famine. It should be observed that we have considered their taxable capacities not only as they are at the present time, or as they will bo in the immediate future but from the point of view also of the capacity of each province for expan-
			sion and development agriculturally and industrially, and by respect of imperfectly developed assets such as minerals and forests. We have
			al&o given consideration to the elasticity of the existing heads of revenue which will be secured to each province, and to the availability of its wealth for taxation. After estimating, to the best of our ability, the weight which should be given to each of these circumstances, we
			recommend the following fixed ratio as representing an equitable basis for the relative contributions of the provinces to the deficit.

			time sufficient to enable them to adjust their budgets to the new 8(a)

			conditions. We further recommend that the interval allowed for adjustment should not be unduly prolonged. The initial ratio which
			we have proposed is a practical necessity, but the provinces which
			will be called upon to pay thereunder more than they should pay
			in equity, ought not to be required to bear that burden for a longer
			period or to a greater extent than is required to prevent dislocation

			should be made on the standard ratio to any deficit that there may
			be in the seventh year of contribution and that the process of
			transition from the initial to the standard ratio should be continuous,
			beginning in the second year of contribution, and proceeding in six
			equal annual steps. The following table shows the initial, intermediate and ultimate ratio of contribution for the seven years,
			in accordance with our recommendations. The initial ratio is the rate per cent of the actual initial contributions recommended in

			29. It should be observed that, if the Government of India fulfil their announced intention of gradually wiping out their deficit, against any increase in the proportion which a province will be called upon to contribute from year to year, there will be set off a reduction in the total to be contributed.
			30. The scheme of contribution that we recommend above complies we believe with the two essential conditions, that any imme- diate dislocation in the provincial budgets must be avoided, and that the admitted inequalities of the proportions in which, in the past, the

			 F1JNA1W1AL DELATIONS COMMITTEE
			64(c>
			provinces have contributed to the purse of the Government of India* must be rectified within a reasonable time. The scheme is subject to the disadvantage that the ratio which we recommend is fixe^and cannot hold good for an indefinite period. We are of opinion How- ever that it will do substantial equity between the provinces until such a period of time has passed as may be required to effect a very substantial change in rh*ir relative states of economic development, a
			-change scarcely to be effected in less than at least a decade, Chapter V. Provincial Loan Account.
			31. The future financing of the Provincial Loan Account is a less controversial subject than the others that we have had to investigate. It is commonly agreed that it is the natural result of the Reforms Scheme that the provinces should for the future finance of their owin'loan transactions and that joint accounts of this nature between them and tho Government of India should be wound up as quickly as possible. In our discussions of this subject with the Provin-
			cial Governments wo have found little or no difference of opinion as to this, and our task has been only to ascertain the wishes of the Provin- cial Qovurmont as to the amount of its account which each can take
			over on 1st, April 1921, and how soon it can take over the rest.
			32. The Government of Bengal, the Panjab, the Central Pro- vinces and Assam signified to us their willingness to take over the whole of their respective loan accounts on 1st, April 1921 and we recommend that it should be arranged for them to do so. In some /oases it was stipulated as a condition that the provincial Government should be allowed to use for the purpose any part of its balance, including the earmarked portion. We see no objection to the con- dition, which accords with the intention expressed in paragraph
			208 of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report.
			33. The Government of Bombay, the United
			Provinces, Burma, Bihar and Orissa signified to us their willingness to take over a portion of their provincial loan accounts on 1st, April 1921 and the remainder in instalments to cover varying periods. The Government of Madras alone expressed unwillingness to take over any part of the account. Evidence was given before us, however, by officials of that Government to the effect that they would not object to do so if the transfer could be effected by fresh credit arrangements. In view of this and of the great improvement which will be effected in the financial position of the province by the redistribution of revenues under the Reforms Scheme, we are of opinion that there is no reason why Madras should form an exception to the general scheme for the transfer of their accounts which we recommend below for application to those provinces which
			are prepared to take over a part of their accounts forthwith.

			 64(<Z)
			EEPOET OF THE
			34. In the case of those provinces, namely, Bombay, the United
			Provinces, Burma, Bihar and Orissa, and including as stated, Madras, we recommend that the Provincial Loan Account should be "funded," at a rate of interest calculated at the weighted average of the three rates of three and half, four and half arid five and half per cent now paid on varying portions of the account. "Whatever portion of the account so '* funded " the province is prepared to take over forthwith
			should, we recommend, be written otf against an equal portion of thi
			35. The provinces in question will probably not be in a position to state the exact proportion of their respective accounts
			which they aro prepared to take over, or the exact number of year* that they will require to repay the balance, until their closing balance
			on 1st April 1921, are more precisely ascertained, and also until they know what contributions will be required from them. It
			provincial balance as from 1st, April 1921 and the balance of tho ;
			" funded" account should remain outstanding as a debt from the pro- vince to the Government of India. On the outstanding balance the province should pay interest at the calculated average rate, and also an annual charge for redemption enough to redeem the debt in a fixed number of years, which should not, save in exceptional circumstances, exceed twelve. The provinces should further have the option to make in any year a large repayment that the fixed redemption charge.
			appears
			therefore that these details must be left for determination
			by future negotiations. Wo are however of opinion that a maximum
			period of twelve years is ample in order to enable any province to
			clear its account and that in some cases the period may with advantage be substantially reduced. We further consider that the fixing of u definite term of lepayment and the provision of an annual charge for redemption within that term are essential in order to secure tho desired clearing accounts between the Provincial Governments and the Government of India.
			Conclusion.
			36. Several other matters were referred to in the course of our enquiry, on which a recommendation appeared to us to be outside thet strict scope of our reference. We propose, however, to communicate our views upon some of them informally to the Government of India.
			37. In conclusion we wish to express our indebtedness to our secretary Mr. Dina Nath Dutt, for his careful and methodical assist- ance in our work. We have also derived very great benefit from the association with us of Mr. C, G. Sim, c.r,E., whom the Govern- ment of India attached to us as liaison officer.

 PREFACE.
The Government of India Act, 191 5, came just too late for inclusion in the original volume ; hence it is published as a small supplementary volume. This statute brings up to date
the record of constitutional landmarks along which the Indian Constitution has developed since the acquisition by the East India Company of the Devvani of Bengal in 1765.

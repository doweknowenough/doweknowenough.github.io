*The Committee has anxiously considered the question whether Andhra should be specifically mentioned as a separate State in this Sche- dule. There was recently a statement by the Government on this subject, in which it was said that Andhra could be included among the Provinces in the Constitution as was done in the case of Orissa and Sind under the Government of India Act, 1995. Accordingly, the Committee was at one stage inolined to mention Andhra as a distinct State in tho Schedule. On fuller consideration, however, the Committee feels that the bare mention' of the State in the Schedule will not suffice to bring it into being from the commencement of the new Constitution. Preparatory steps will have to< be taken immediately under the present Constitution in order that the new State, with all the machinery of government, may be in being from the commencement of the new Constitution. This was what was done in the caBe of Orissa and Sind under the Act of 1985 : they were made into sepa- i^te Provinces with effect from April 1, 1986, while the Act came into operation on April 1, 1937. Tho Committee therefore recommends that a Commission should be appointed to work out or inquire into all relevant matters not only as regards Andhra but also (is regards other linguistic
ifiteglons', with instructions to subtnit its report in time to enable any new States whose formation it may recommend to be created under section 290- of the Act of 1985 and to be mentioned in this Sohedule before the Consti- tution is finally adopted.

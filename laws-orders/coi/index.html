as if-
in sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 4, the provision for consultation with the Government of the State concerned had been omitted;
in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 6, for the words "to which the executive power of the State extends", the words "with respect to which the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory of Mizoram has power to make laws" had been substituted;
in paragraph 13, the words and figures "under article 202" had been omitted.
21. Amendment of the Schedule
Parliament may from time to time by law amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any of the provisions of this Schedule and, when the Schedule is so amended, any reference to this Schedule in this Constitution shall be construed as a reference to such Schedule as so amended.

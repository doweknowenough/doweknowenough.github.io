        	Tips
        </h3>
        <ol>
        	<li>
        		Patience is important. Tracking such large amount of data is going to take years
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		Currently at least establish the links to the act and rules
        	</li>
            <li>
                In future, see if it is possible to track complete history of the act i.e. keeping a record what was changed via every amendment
            </li>
        	<li>
        		Amending legislations shall be listed in decreasing order of coming into force
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		Any act amending multiple acts shall be placed under heading of all such acts
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		Rules, Circulars, Notifications are to be collected
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		Ordering shall be done by year of passing of the principal act
        	</li>
        	<li>
                Separate section in website for acts which are no longer in force
            </li>
            <li>
        		Separate section in website for acts or parts thereof which were passed but not currently in force i.e. stay on implementation or execution or not notifying in the gazette
        	</li>

        		Constitution shall be placed under a different section in the website
        	</li>
            <li>
                To ensure smooth functioning each principal act can be made into a different webpage and only links to those webpages can be maintained on the home page of this section. This should be done only after significantly completing the project
            </li>
            <li>
                If possible, make different sections which can then be combined into codes. This listing can be made on the home page of this section only. Eg- Finance section shall incorporate Indian Sharemarket Code which shall incorporate SEBI Act, Securities Act etc.
            </li>
            <li>
